Open The HTML file in your browser. And scroll thru the locations.

From there, you can get a street view on available locations.

Note to reviewer:

Okay. . . Here is my submission. . .
 
Like I said, I almost had Foursquare, but I didn't want to go on forums [either Stack Overflow, or the Udacity forums], because I would have to wait for an answer, and I'm working on a timeline.
 
So instead, I used gmaps.js, to basically sync with the LatLong, and I also made an API call using Google Street View [only 1 street view appears]. . . It is also responsive, though it is not beautiful in layout.
 
The code is all mine, using refs from the Udacity Google API course. And the code is functional, providing extra data on locations. I hope that is sufficient.
 
Regards, and thank you. Matthew Topartzer
